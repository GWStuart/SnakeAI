# Setup / Installation
Not much do it but make sure to install the `pip` dependencies.
I would recommend doing this in a python virtual environment.
- `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Program Overview
The core game logic for the snake game is stored in the [gameLogic](gameLogic) package.

The AI bots are defined in their own packages labelled `botx` where `x` is a number.
There are currently two completed bots (but more are being developed)

The `botTester.py` program is used to test the AI bots. It will simulate a complete snake game abiding by the rules in the [gameLogic](gameLogic) and choosing the move generated by the bot that is being tested. The output of the game including all the required information to reconstruct the entire game is saved in an output. The default location of this output file is `/saves/games/OUTPUT_NAME.snake`.

To render a saved game use the [render](render) package. This package generates an mp4 video output of the game with several customisation options available including varying output quality and FPS (see more below).

Additionally you can interactively test the bots using the [botSim.py](botSim.py) file. The user can also play/test the snake game themselves using the [game.py](game.py) file.

# Usage
Some useful bash aliases can be enbled using:
- `source commands.sh`
(note this guide will act as if these aliases are being used. If that is not the case then just type out the whole command)


## Testing a Bot
If you are looking to test `bot1` then this is simply achieved with the command,
- `test bot1`

As described above, this will show you the bots final socre and will generate a save file than can be optionally rendered in future.

Several command line options are available and I'll share the output of `test --help` below,

## Rendering a Saved Game
To render a game saved at the location `saves/games/output.snake` then use the following command,
- `render saaves/games/output.snake`

The output of the script will be an mp4 file which is by default located at `saves/renders/output.mp4`.

Like with the bot testing command, several command line options are available. I will again show the output of `render --help` below,

## Using the Bot Simulator
The bot simulator is a useful program to help better understand the decisions made by the bot. This program allows the user to interactively step through the bot's decisions.

For a basic usage:
- click to add "obstacles" (these are treated in the same way as the snake body)
- "b" to spawn the head of the snake bot
- "a" to spawn the apple
- "SPACE" to step through a move
- "s" to save the current state to a file
- "o" to open a save file
- "t" to record the amount of time it takes for the bot to reach the apple

See within the file for more customisation options.

# Creating a Custom Bot
The project is designed in such a way that it is very easy to create your own bots.

The process is as follows:
- Create a new python package for the bot
- Within the package create a class that should inherit from the abstract bot.
```python
from abstractBot import Bot

class MyBot(Bot):
  pass
```
- You should then overwrite the `makeMove` method which is the method called by the bot tester
```python
"""
Make a snake move based on the provided information
@param snake the snake's body with the head as the last element
@param apple the cell position of the apple
@returns the move direction as a tuple of the x, y direction
"""
def makeMove(self, snake: list[tuple[int, int[[, apple: tuple[int, int]) -> tuple[int, int]:
  return (1, 0)  # this bot only moves right
```

The [abstractBot](abstractBot.py) contains several useful functions that you may want to use in your own custom bot.
